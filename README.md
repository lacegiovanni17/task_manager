# TASK MANAGER
# task_manager_api (backend project)
The Task Manager ✅ API is a robust backend service that helps users manage their tasks 📋 efficiently and securely.
Users can create, update, and delete tasks 🛠️, track progress with status updates ⏳, and retrieve task details with ease.
JWT-based authentication 🔐 ensures only authorized users can access or modify their tasks, maintaining data privacy.
Built with Node.js 🟢, Express 🚀, TypeScript 📜, and MongoDB 🍃, the API is modular 🧱, scalable ⚡, and easy to maintain.
It supports clean architecture for clear separation of concerns, making the system testable 🧪 and production-ready.
Whether you're tracking personal goals 🎯 or managing daily work tasks 🗂️, this API keeps you organized and productive.
